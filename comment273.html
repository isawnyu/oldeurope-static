					<div class='reader_time'>Svet<br />03:53 AM</div><div class='reader_comment'>Most probably you are absolutelly right! One of the best researchers of Cicladic figurines, Renfrew, writes in 1972:"–	“The Hasanoglan figurine could be imagined as a rather thin Anatolian variant of this Bulgarian form, which in one case (Blagoevo near Razgrad) attains the height of 35 cm. Even the separate ankle rings in the Hasanoglan example find parallels in copper on some of the Bulgarian figurines. The extent of Bulgarian influence on Anatolia at the end of the Chalcolithic period has yet to be estab- lished, but the close similarity between the finds of Karanovo VII or Dipsiskata Mogila and those of Troy I and Thermi indicate that there is at least a possibility of Bulgarian Chalcolithic traditions surviving into the Anatolian, and hence the Aegean, Early Bronze Age. In this case the similarity between the Cycladic and the Bulgarian figurines would not be fortuitous. The Bulgarian figurines could be prototypes for the folded-arm position both in the Cyclades and the Hasanoglan figurine. All this is of course hypothetical at the moment, and will remain so until we know more of Aegean/ Anatolian/Balkan contacts at this time. But it is, perhaps, worth remembering that what at first appear to be somewhat superficial similarities may have a genuine historical cause.” Renfrew, C. 1969.

Varna chalcolithic necropolis is dated in the late Chalcolithe (the end of 5th Millenium BC) and responds to the archealogical periods Karanovo V and Karanovo VI 

The necropolis is situated on the northen shore of the lake of Varna, almost 300 burials are explored. More than 6 kg of gold objects are found. The necropolis reflects an early class of of a costal civilization of the Weastern Black seaside, which is superior in comparison with the synchronous cultures from the continental inland. Most of the costal settelments of this early European civiliztion are under the sea – water today.
