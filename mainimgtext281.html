The three elements were meant to be used as an ensemble and are covered with a pattern of interlocking black spiral outlines placed against a red background. While the vessel&rsquo;s ultimate function is still subject to debate, its impressive monumental size, combined with its complex tripartite construction and intricate decoration, suggests a ceremonial purpose clearly distinct from the original utilitarian function of ceramics.</p><div>&nbsp;</div>
