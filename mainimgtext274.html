The figurines produced by these groups are marked by a lack of detail in the body parts and by the absence of heads. They are generally defined instead by pillar necks, wide hips, and arms that frequently end without hands. Many are shown with large breasts and bellies, prompting some scholars to read them as pregnant females, thus relating them to rituals of fertility and fecundity.</p><div>&nbsp;</div>
