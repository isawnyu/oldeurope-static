The opening possibly indicates a doorway, while the painted geometric patterns resemble known decorations from Cucuteni households and temples, suggesting that the model represents a domestic or religious space. The miniaturization of both the human figures and the architectural structures elucidates the complex relationship between Old Europeans and the built spaces defining their communities.</p>
