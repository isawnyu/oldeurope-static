The miniaturized female bodies, as in this figurine, are characterized by abstraction with truncated, elongated, or emphasized body parts, and their surfaces are decorated with incised or painted geometric and abstract patterns. The heightened sense of female corporality has led traditional scholarship to identify these figurines as representations of a powerful mother goddess, whose relationship to earthly and human fertility is demonstrated by the remarkable, sexualized forms. However, this single, overarching interpretation has recently been challenged: the great variety of contexts in which the figurines are found (burials, households, hoards, and sanctuaries) suggests that they might have assumed different social, cultural, and even religious connotations according to the specific audience and environment for which they were modeled.</p><div>&nbsp;</div><p>&nbsp;</p>
