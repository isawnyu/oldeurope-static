The burials and grave goods found there, and at forty other necropoleis spread throughout the lower Danube valley, constitute the only material remains of the Suvorovo-Novodanilovka culture, a prehistoric nomadic group. The necklace, comprised of two different shell types found in the Black Sea, was discovered in a child&rsquo;s grave together with other grave goods made of marble and copper.</p>
