County Museum Complex, Piatra Neam?: 16422<br />Photo: Marius Amarie</span></strong></p><p align=""><br />During the last phase of Cucuteni history, human figures and animals&mdash;previously present only as three-dimensional figurines that were more or less naturalistically rendered&mdash;began to appear also as painted decorations on ceramic vessels. This amphora, thought to be used for storage of both liquids and solids, shows two decorative registers outlined in black color over an off-white polished background. The main register is characterized by a complex arrangement of ovals, trapeziums, triangles, and diamonds, all defined by series of concentric lines. The background of the vessel contains ten highly stylized human figures comprised of two mirrored triangles surmounted by a circle to outline the body and the head, and two swerving lines terminating in disks to depict arms. Often interpreted as female figures, these forms raise interesting questions related to the supposed, but not certain, existence of a Cucuteni pantheon, and to a possible ritualistic use for the vessel.</p><div>&nbsp;</div>
