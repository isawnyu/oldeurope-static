			<br /><p align=""><strong>Architectural Model,&nbsp;Fired Clay,&nbsp;Gumelni?a, C?scioarele, 4600&ndash;3900 <span style="font-size: smaller;">BC</span><br /></strong><strong><span style="color: rgb(128, 128, 128);">National History Museum of Romania, Bucharest: 12156<br />Photo: Marius Amarie<br /><br type="_moz" /></span></strong><b><br /></b></p><p align="">Excavated in 1966 at C?scioarele&mdash;a river-island settlement of the Gumelni?a culture&mdash;this architectural model was discovered close to a large house and a sacrificial area, identified as a sanctuary and characterized by what were possibly a bench-altar and numerous cult vases. The surface of the model is enlivened by incisions and paint that define a series of four architectural buildings, variously interpreted as temples or households. Each of the buildings has an arched doorway with gables similar to a bull&rsquo;s horns. The buildings are set on a relatively tall substructure decorated with horizontal lines and ten round holes. This substructure may represent a stylized tell, or artificial mounds. Neolithic models are usually seen as cult objects that reflect an unknown religious custom.</p><div>&nbsp;</div>
