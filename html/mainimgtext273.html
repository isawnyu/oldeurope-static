			<br /><p align=""><strong>&ldquo;The Thinker&rdquo; and Female Figurine from Cernavod?,&nbsp;Fired Clay,&nbsp;Hamangia, Cernavod?, 5000&ndash;4600 <span style="font-size: smaller;">BC</span><br /><span style="color: rgb(128, 128, 128);">National History Museum of Romania, Bucharest: 15906, 15907<br />Photo: Marius Amarie<br /></span></strong><b><br /></b>In 1956 these two figurines were found among the grave goods excavated at the Hamangia necropolis of Cernavod?. The male figure, elbows on his knees and hands on either side of his face, sits on a low four-legged stool. The woman, seated on the ground, has one leg extended forward and the other bent at the knee. In the Neolithic period, male figurines constituted a small minority of the very large corpus of figurines found both in necropoleis and in households. Even more striking is the fact that &ldquo;The Thinker&rdquo; is coupled with a female figurine, a decided rarity that clearly indicates a direct relationship between the two. While his gesture has been interpreted as reflective of a pensive state, it could also be taken as a symbol of mourning. Both figurines were deposited in a grave beside the inhumed body, as if to accompany the deceased into the afterlife.</p>
