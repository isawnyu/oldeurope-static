The discovery of smelting permitted metalworkers to extract huge quantities of pure metallic copper from the abundant malachite and azurite ores of southeastern Europe, and led quickly to the excavation of large mines in Bulgaria and Serbia.<br />The differing styles of cast hammer-axes and axe-adzes, the most complex products of Old European metallurgy, suggest that there might have been three principal regional schools of copper metalworking: one centered in Bulgaria, another in northern Serbia, and a third somewhere in the western Carpathians. The strongly arched shape of this axe relates it to the Carpathian school of metalworking. Suggestions of wear can be found throughout its surface.</p>
