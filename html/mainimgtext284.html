Featuring a wide array of decorative motifs, including meanders, spirals, waves, and zigzag lines, the seals may have been used to print or impress onto a range of materials (textiles, leather, human skin, and even bread). Interestingly, the patterns incised on the discs find close comparisons with those painted on contemporaneous ceramic vessels and other decorated artifacts.</p>
