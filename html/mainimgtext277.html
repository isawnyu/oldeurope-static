			<br /><p align=""><strong>Spondylus Bracelet,&nbsp;Spondylus,&nbsp;Hamangia Culture, Cernavod?, ca. 5000&ndash;4600 bc<br /></strong><span style="color: rgb(128, 128, 128);"><strong>National History Museum of Romania, Bucharest: 11666<br />Photo: Marius Amarie<br /></strong></span><span style="color: rgb(128, 128, 128);"><strong><br /></strong></span><br />Made of Spondylus gaederopus, a shell found only in the Mediterranean Sea, this bracelet attests to the oldest long-distance trade of a specific, identifiable natural resource. Archaeological excavations throughout modern Europe have confirmed the existence in the fifth millennium <small>BC</small> of a complex exchange network that allowed for transportation of this precious material over nearly three thousand kilometers, from the Aegean coasts all the way to Britain. Traded mostly in an unworked or roughly worked state, the shells were locally carved to fulfill the desired aesthetics of the Neolithic societies that acquired them. This conically shaped bracelet is made from a single shell and is of a type favored by the Hamangia culture.</p>
