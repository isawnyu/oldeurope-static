			<br /><p align=""><strong>Pintadera in the Shape of a Left Leg,&nbsp;Fired Clay,&nbsp;Star?evo-Cri?, Z?uan, 6200 &ndash;5500 <span style="font-size: smaller;">BC</span><br /></strong><strong><span style="color: rgb(128, 128, 128);">County Museum of History and Art, Zal?u: 25/1977<br />Photo: Marius Amarie<br /><br /></span></strong></p><p align="">This pintadera in the shape of a left leg was found in a domestic context at a site belonging to the Star?evo-Cri? culture, one of the first and oldest identifiable cultural groups of Old European farmers. This pintadera is decidedly exceptional, particularly when compared with the common circular type with small knobs. The leg would have been held by the individual who was using it to mark an object with its zig-zag insignia.&nbsp; Whether the leg carried symbolic meaning is unknown. Its unique shape, however, suggests that it held a special place with its owner.</p>
